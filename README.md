# ml-lime-shap-disease-prediction
A machine learning-based approach to predicting tropical diseases in patients with model explainability using LIME and SHAP.

This project leverages machine learning and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to predict tropical diseases in patients based on symptoms and risk factors. The goal is to improve diagnostic support by providing interpretable model predictions using **LIME** and **SHAP**.

## üéØ Objectives

- Predict multiple tropical diseases using patient symptoms.
- Apply ML models.
- Use **LIME** and **SHAP** to explain model predictions in a human-interpretable way.
- Support healthcare decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
